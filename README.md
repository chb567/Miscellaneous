# Miscellaneous
hopefully various small programs

Hi all,
I'm an incredibly lazy person, and I cant be bothered looking through others code,
so I either forget about it or write my own. My code kinda sucks so, its ur risk!

Everything in this repository can be used, edited or whatever but please not in my name. :)
